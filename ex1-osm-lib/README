ANSWERS:
assignment 1:
The program WhatIDo is a program that expects to get 1 argument of any type (digit\letter etc.)
If the program does not get an argument it throws an error.
If the program gets the needed argument it does the following things:
(1) creates a directory tree called Welcome
(2) inside the above directory, it creates another folder named "To"
(3) In the last directory in the tree, the program creates a file called OS2021 and opens it by using the 
openat command that opens a file relative to a directory file descriptor
(4) Then the program uses fstat to get information about the file.
(5) In the file created above the program writes the message:
 'hellyalpern\nIf you haven't read the course guidelines yet --- do it right now!\n1'
the messege structre is:
	* user login - like hellyalpern\yanivpe
	* new line
	* If you haven't read the course guidelines yet --- do it right now!
	* new line
	* The argument the program got
(6) the program deletes the file OS2021 - by using the unlink command that deletes a name and the file it refers to
(7) the program deletes the directory Welcome\To
(8) the program deletes the directory Welcome
